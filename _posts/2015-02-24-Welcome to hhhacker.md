#Hello Hackers!

Welcome to hhhacker, a blog/community/store for hackers, by hackers. My name is [Conlin Durbin](http://conlin.me). I started hhhacker after a making a [JS t-shirt](http://teespring.com/js-wireframe) and thinking about the lack of quality hacker related shirts. I decided to start a teespring store and this blog.

I don't know what direction this will take, but I know I want to make hhhackers first and foremost a community. That means open sourcing the t-shirt design process, having community blog posts, and talking and meeting with hackers at hackathons.

Be on the lookout for some cool stuff coming from here and don't hesitate to reach out!
